# Faculty_Project_ACP_Course

> Here I tried to built a small Educational Management System using `structs` instead of `classes` as The course teach only Basics C++.

> I have a little problems which should be solved in the fuuture version of the prototype version of th system:  

    1. use smart pointers instead of raw pointers to prevent memory leaks
    2. learn jason to store and retrieve your data instead of starting from scratch each time.
    3. try to enhance the structs to be more like the project at the end of the course.
    4. try to rewrite the System but with using OOP concepts.
